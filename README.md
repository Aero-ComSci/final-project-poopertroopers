## üéØ What Does the Code Do?
- Collects user responses to summer-related questions.
- Stores answers in JSON format for data analysis.
- Displays results dynamically based on stored data.
- Provides basic automation using **JavaScript** and **localStorage**.

## üîç Logic Behind the Project
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ User Input Handling**
- Users fill out the survey form (`qs.html`).
- JavaScript (`answers.js`) retrieves their inputs.
- The data is formatted into a JSON object.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Storing and Processing Data**
- The questionnaire stores responses in `localStorage` for persistence.
- A separate array (`vacationData`) records all vacation destinations.
- When a user submits the form, their vacation choice is added to the dataset.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Displaying Results in `end.html`**
- The results page loads stored vacation data.
- It counts how many users selected the same destination.
- The results are dynamically displayed using JavaScript.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Optional Enhancements**
- Responses could be stored in an **actual database** instead of localStorage.
- The questionnaire could include **filters** for specific types of vacations.
- Data visualization (charts/graphs) could make vacation trends more interactive.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots & Code Examples
Below are some samples of stored JSON data, and response tracking.

*Example JSON Data Structure:*
```json
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "vacation": "Hawaii",
    "poop_per_day": 2
}
